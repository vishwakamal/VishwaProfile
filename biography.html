    <h1>Biography about Stephen Hawking</h1>
    <h3>Who is Stephen Hawking</h3>
    Stephen Hawking (January 8, 1942 to March 14, 2018) 
    was a British scientist, professor and author who 
    performed groundbreaking work in physics and cosmology,
     and whose books helped to make science accessible to 
     everyone. At age 21, while studying cosmology at the
      University of Cambridge, he was diagnosed with 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Part of his life 
      story was depicted in the 2014 film The Theory of Everything.
<h3>BLack Holes</h3>
In 1974, Hawking's research turned him into a celebrity
 within the scientific world when he showed that black
  holes aren't the information vacuums that scientists
   had thought they were. In simple terms, Hawking 
   demonstrated that matter, in the form of radiation,
    can escape the gravitational force of a collapsed star.
     Another young cosmologist, Roger Penrose, had earlier 
     discovered groundbreaking findings about the fate of 
     stars and the creation of black holes, which tapped into 
     Hawking's own fascination with how the universe began.
      The pair then began working together to expand upon
       Penroseâ€™s earlier work, setting Hawking on a career 
       course marked by awards, notoriety and distinguished 
       titles that reshaped the way the world thinks about 
       black holes and the universe. 
       <h3>Death</h3>
       On March 14, 2018, Hawking finally succumbed 
       to the disease that was supposed to have killed 
       him more than 50 years earlier. A family spokesman
        confirmed that the iconic scientist died at his 
        home in Cambridge, England.
